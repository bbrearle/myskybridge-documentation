#Using Myskybridge
Myskybridge seeks to keep the students at the center of everything we do. To support the full student team of teachers, therapists, and parents, the student notebook is the place everything comes together.

The notebook is where all the lesson plans, worksheets, progress, and comments are kept for a specific student.

Go here to learn about Creating a new worksheet.
Go here to learn about Adding worksheets to lesson plans.


##Creating a new lesson plan
A **lesson plan** is a therapist’s detailed description of the course of instruction for one session. A lesson plan can be added to multiple students. A lesson plan is made up of a collection of worksheets, and information pertaining to the target objective, grade level, and goal of the lesson plan.

<img class="doc-img" src="/images/docs/Screenshot%202014-10-14%2015.04.17.png" />

Lesson plans can be created to be used for multiple students (template), or custom for a single student.

Go here to learn about Customizing lesson plans.

To create a lesson plan template (a lesson plan that is available to be used for multiple students), you will first click on the plans navigation menu.

You will be directed to the lesson plan library. The lesson plan library will list all available lesson plan templates. To create a new lesson plan, click ‘+ Create New’.

You will then enter the title, goal, target objective, and grade of lesson plan. If you have already created worksheets you can click ‘Select Worksheet’ and attach the appropriate collection of worksheets.

##Creating a new worksheet
A **worksheet** is an individual element of a lesson plan. A worksheet can be added to multiple lesson plans, and ultimately to multiple students. A worksheet is made up of a title, detailed description, category, grade level, difficulty, and an attached document (pdf). 

Worksheets are added to lesson plans, and serve as the individual steps in completing a lesson plan.

Go here to learn about Adding worksheets to lesson plans.

Changes to worksheets are global. This means that any change to a worksheet will be reflected in all lesson plans that currently contain the worksheet, as well as any student that is currently assigned the lesson plan containing the edited worksheet.

Attachments can be added to the worksheet by clicking ‘Choose file’, locating the file and selecting the file you wish to attached. Once uploaded users (therapists, students, and teachers) can view, download and print the attachment by clicking ‘View’ from within the worksheet.

Worksheets are also accessible from the student notebook.

Go here to learn more about Using student notebooks.

##Adding worksheets to lesson plans

<img class="doc-img" src="/images/docs/Screenshot%202014-10-14%2016.10.23.png" />

Once the student has finished all the worksheets from within a specific lesson plan, you can flag the lesson plan as complete. To do this, locate the lesson plan from the list within the student notebook, open the lesson plan, and select the ‘Plan is complete’ check box.


<img class="doc-img" src="/images/docs/Screenshot%202014-10-14%2016.17.23.png" />

To deactivate a lesson plan, or remove a complete status from the lesson plan, simply open the lesson plan and deselect the corresponding check box.
##Customizing lesson plans
Once the lesson plan has been added to a student notebook, it is now assigned to a student, and changes to the master template will no longer affect the student’s version of the lesson plan.
